A C++ tool that analyzes Telegram chat export JSON files and reveals the real numeric user ID behind anonymous chat bots.

🚀 What does it do?

Telegram “anonymous chat” bots hide the real user identity.
However, Telegram exports the entire raw chat data — including encoded identifiers.

This tool:

1. Parses Telegram exported .json files


2. Finds Base64-encoded user identifiers


3. Decodes them


4. Prints the real numeric Telegram user ID



⚠️ It does NOT hack Telegram.
It simply reads the data YOU exported from your own device.
